    What does it mean everywhere?
        -current class-outside the current class-within package-outside package

    **default**
    the access level is only within package
    if we do not type access modifier, it will be default.

    **protected**
    child class can reach parent class, even if it is outside the package

    **private**
    the access level is only within the class
    it cannot reach from outside the class

    **private constructor role**
    you cannot create the instance out of class

    **local variables**
